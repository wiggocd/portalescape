# portalescape / FunkoFox: Escape the Facility
A 2D platformer in which you must escape a testing facility using only your portal gun - the game was made predominantly using typescript and the Phaser 3 game engine.
Art done by the awesome Ayaan Asif and work done around the project by the brilliant Theo Glassbrook and Harry Constable-Barnes.
