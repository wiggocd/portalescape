    <h1>Aim of the game!</h1>
    <p>You, Funko The Fox, must escape the facility and your captor using only your portal gun to complete fun puzzles around an underground world. At the end, you must defeat your captor. (Read more in the about section of the app).</p>
    <h1>Movement</h1>
    <p>To make the fox move, tap where you want to move. To jump, tap above the fox.</p>
    <h1>Completing Levels</h1>
    <p>To complete a level you must get to the level exit labeled with a green exit sign. To get there, you must place portals, teleport through them and avoid enemies: the machines.</p>
    <h1>How do you use portals?</h1>
    <p>You can have a maximum of two portals at once. You can use them to teleport; if you walk through one portal, you come out of the other. To place a portal, <i>double tap where you want the portal.</i> You can only place portals on the green blocks. When you get to certain areas, more green blocks will appear. If a block is red you cannot place a portal on it.</p>
