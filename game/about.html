    <h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <p>Our aim was to make a puzzle game with added mechanics from a couple of inspiring PC games to create a small mobile project. This game was made in support of RSPCA charity and is designed to run from our app in Thunkable X.</p>
    <h1>The Game: FunkoFox: Escape The Facility</h1>
    <p>FunkoFox: Escape The Facility is a 2D platforming game where you must escape a testing facility and your captor using only your portal gun to complete fun puzzles around a basic underground world.
    At the end of the game, you will reach the point of finishing off the last monster: the human who has been keeping you captured the whole time for animal testing. This theme was put in to relate to animal cruelty that happens in our world and needs to be eradicated!</p>
    <p>To help the RSPCA anti-animal cruelty charity, you can donate to them from our app to raise awareness and bring other animals to the same rights as us humans.</p>
